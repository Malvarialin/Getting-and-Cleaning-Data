#Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository is for storing appropriate scripts for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" class taught by John Hopkins University through Coursera.

##Course Project

The source of the data used in this analysis comes from the UCI HAR Dataset directory.

The purpose of the run_analysis.R script is to merge all of the  data stored in various files into one nice dataset and then create a new tidy dataset that calculates the mean and standard deviation of each variable tested.  The general process is as follows.

*Create individual datasets and merge the similar ones together.

*Extract only the relevant information from this set.

*Replace the place holder variables with descriptive ones so reading it makes more sense. (clean data.txt)

*Create a new dataset from this that calculates the mean and standard deviation of each of these variables and write this new table to a file called 'Tidy Data.txt'
